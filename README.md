### Homework 1

- Plot temperature anomalies over time.
- Estimate and plot the sample autocorrelation functions of the raw series and its first difference.

### Homework 2

- Given an ARMA(2, 2) process with alpha lag polynominal [1, -1, 1/4] and beta lag polynominal [1, 1/4, 1/4], graph the autocorrelation up to k = 9. Use Yule-Walker and MA technique to calculate autocovariance.
